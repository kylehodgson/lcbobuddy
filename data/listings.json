		 "description": "Cono Sur makes the world’s best $10 viognier. There are classic aromas of star fruit, lychee, spearmint and pepper with orange marmalade and spice. It’s mid-weight and a touch sweet, yet lively. It’s a great aperitif white.",

This mid-weight, fleshy and dense red exudes ­flavours of black raspberry, herbs and tobacco. Some youthful, drying ­tannin. Best 2013 to 2015. Serve it with duck. ",
